# üîí Security Guidelines

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Security Notes

### Environment Variables
- **NEVER** commit `.env` files to version control
- Use `env.template` as a reference for required variables
- Store sensitive data in secure environment variable management systems
- Rotate secrets regularly

### Database Security
- Use strong passwords for database connections
- Enable SSL/TLS for database connections in production
- Restrict database access to specific IP addresses
- Regularly backup your database

### API Security
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Use HTTPS in production environments
- Validate all input data
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Log security events

### Docker Security
- Use specific image tags instead of `latest`
- Regularly update base images
- Run containers as non-root users
- Use secrets management for sensitive data
- Scan images for vulnerabilities

### Network Security
- Use firewalls to restrict access
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Use reverse proxies (Traefik/Nginx) for SSL termination
- Monitor network traffic

## üõ°Ô∏è Best Practices

### 1. Environment Configuration
```bash
# Copy template and configure
cp env.template .env
# Edit .env with your actual values
# NEVER commit .env to git
```

### 2. Database Connection
```bash
# Use environment variables for database URLs
DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@host:port/database?sslmode=require
```

### 3. API Keys and Secrets
```bash
# Store in environment variables
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-here
API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

### 4. Production Deployment
- Use HTTPS with valid SSL certificates
- Implement proper logging and monitoring
- Set up automated backups
- Use container orchestration (Docker Swarm/Kubernetes)
- Implement health checks

## üö® Security Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] All sensitive data removed from code
- [ ] Environment variables properly configured
- [ ] Database connections secured with SSL
- [ ] HTTPS enabled with valid certificates
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented
- [ ] CORS properly configured
- [ ] Authentication/authorization implemented
- [ ] Logging and monitoring set up
- [ ] Backup strategy in place
- [ ] Security headers configured
- [ ] Dependencies updated to latest versions
- [ ] Container images scanned for vulnerabilities

## üìû Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Email security concerns to: security@your-domain.com
3. Include detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow reasonable time for response before public disclosure

## üîÑ Regular Security Tasks

- [ ] Update dependencies monthly
- [ ] Rotate secrets quarterly
- [ ] Review access logs weekly
- [ ] Perform security scans monthly
- [ ] Update SSL certificates before expiration
- [ ] Review and update security policies annually
